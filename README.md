## About This Project
This is a pure Java project, made using Eclipse. It was pioneered for a client in my community, Qari Abdul Rahman, who runs an Islamic institution, a madersa, to teach young boys the Qura'an, a holy book. Many kids including my brother attend, which was how I had become aware about the need for this system. In the past, Mr. Abdul had no help running the institute and the student’s information and other data were all recorded by hand. These files were constantly at risk of damage or misplacement, and because of the pandemic happening at the time of this project, records of covid-screening and student progress, which were given monthly, had become increasingly difficult to manage. Students had an agenda where the teacher recorded their daily progress and composed a progress report. Mr. Abdul was the only teacher in this madrasa and as it started to gain popularity, he was in charge of being aware of the details of each individual. This had become a stressful process for him. Now introduce this system, constructed to make his life a whole lot easier. Among many other functionalities, it could track and administer COVID screenings and attendences for all students, as well as keep track of each students' personal and emergency records, record daily progresses for the different types of students in the madersa and generate monthly progress reports to give to parents at the end of each month. Basically, an automated assistent teacher who helped Mr. Abdul with all the low level work.
